sorting complexities

naive n^2 
suppose india has 1 bil phones 10^9 
speed in seconds = 10^9x2/ 10^8 (comp speed) 
smart nlogn
3x10^10/10^8 = 300s

videogame monitor  has 3.75 millions points 
suppose we've 500000 objs 5x10^5
then naive 25x10^10 taking upto 42 mins response time 
smart nlogn takes secs

order of mag & constants ( visit limits, asymptotic complextiy)

logn n nlogn n^2 n^3  2^n n!

O(n2 log n) is an upper bound on worst-case complexity.
 It does not force any input to actually take that much time to solve. 
So the only contradiction is the statement that there are infinitely many n for which there are inputs of size n that take time O(n3).
