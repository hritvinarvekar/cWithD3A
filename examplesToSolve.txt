 1) Compute pairs of A & B such that they're connected by sequence of flights 
N cities F direct flights how much large value can we handle of both?? (response in seconds) 
Constraints : waiting time, aircraft maintence, cheapest routee

2) Xerox Shop: allocate jobs such that revenue is maximized: No. of pages for each job is known, but if deadline is not met, discount is offered.
brute force: try all possible locations, choose the optimal one
decomposition: fix one job to run first, remaining jobs smaller in no. recursion
greedy: some strategy for the jobs
variations: old machine, price varies w machine & machine cannot run indef.

3)Document check: web search queries
distance, types of changes allowed?
brute: delete & insert
decomposition: first change, then recursively do it
eg naive recursion sum of fibonacci nos
dynamic programming: do not compute same sub problem
save it & look it up
variations: focused on "meanings"
